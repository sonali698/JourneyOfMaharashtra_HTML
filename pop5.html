	<h1 style="font-size:50px;text-align:center;">Flipping The Pages Of History</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>Different dynasties and rulers have swept through Maharashtra through the ages, bringing with them the different form of the traditional, art, social practices and architectures. The state features over 350 forts - the largest number in any state in India. The celebrated heritage sites of Maharashtra are the testimony of how grand and glorious were these dynasties. All these great architectures, in the form of forts, palaces, and even caves, commemorate the grand events and episodes that took place in the history. And are significant from their historical, cultural and archeological standpoint. The architectural work that has been done in these places is patronized by some of the finest artisans and designers, invited from the different parts of the world.</p>
	<p>Going by the records of Maharashtra tourism, here one can see monuments that are as old as 4th century BC; the perfect example of the same is the Ajanta and Ellora caves near Aurangabad. The finest form of sculptures, designs, carving and statues in these caves describe the reveal the centuries old religious and artistic tradition present in the state. Soon after the Rashtrakuta dynasty, who were the makers of the Ellora Caves, Seuna (Yadava) dynasty rose to power in Maharashtra and left their mark in the form of Daulatabad Fort, which is 15 km from Aurangabad. In the 14th century, many Islamic rulers governed the state, and that's when Mughal emperor, Aurangzeb built the replica of Taj Mahal, Bibi Ka Maqbara in Aurangabad. During this reign, Maharashtra architecture saw a new aesthetic and a concept of Islamic architecture was introduced. The historical places of Maharashtra started capturing eyeballs in early 17th century when Marathas came into power.</p>
	<p>Their stronghold in the region such as Pune, Panhala and Mahad led to the creation of grand fort complexes and cities. During the reign of Marathas, heritage travel places like Shaniwar Wada (Pune), Lal Mahal (Pune), Ahmednagar Fort (Satara District, Raigad Fort (Mahad) and Sindhudurg Fort (Sindhudurg District ) were built.</p>
	<p>Later, with the arrival of colonial rulers in the 18th century, new architectural features and techniques were used again. During the colonial rule in India, when Mumbai was Bombay, Britons made many architectural masterpieces like Gateway of India, Rajabai Clock Tower, Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, and Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, which has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Portuguese too has left their mark in Maharashtra in the form of the Vasai Fort, which was initially built a ship building site. The pulse of Portuguese and their lifestyle still echoes in the Vasai fort. When European settlers came to Maharashtra, they made their impression on almost everything except one place, precisely a fort, called Murud Janjira. One of the strongest fort ever made in India, it remained unconquered until it became part of Indian territory after Independence.</p>

	<h1 style="font-size:50px;text-align:center;">Bibi Ka Maqbara</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>5 kilometer off the roads of the Aurangabad city stands the colossal beauty, and the most impressive monument of Aurangabad - Bibi Ka Maqbara, which bears a strong resemblance to the iconic Taj Mahal in Agra. It is mainly a mausoleum marking the burial ground of Aurangzeb's wife, Rabia-Durrani. Aurangzeb started constructing the Bibi Ka Maqbara, but it was his son Prince Azam Shah who completed its construction. One of the most perfectly proportioned and captivating Mughal mausoleums, the structure of Bibi Ka Maqbara, which brings together Persian and Mughal elements, was designed and erected by Ata-ullah, an architect, and Hanspat Rai, an engineer respectively. Ata-ullah was the son of Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, the main designer of the Taj Mahal.</p>
	<p>Like Taj Mahal, Bibi Ka Maqbara too is located amidst a manicured garden with axial ponds, fountains, and water channels, and lined with broad pathways. The garden is further enclosed by high crenelated walls with fortress set at intervals, and open pavilions on three sides. The mausoleum is built in a Charbagh style on a raised platform to be reached by a fleet of stairs. Its distinctive interiors are also a class apart. To reach the main octagonal chamber containing the unadorned grave, one needs to descend the flight of stairs. The grave is enclosed in a perforated marble screens. The chamber above is a high square structure presenting identical facades on four sides.Each corner of the mausoleum, even the cusps, and doorways are finely carved. Like Taj Mahal, it too uses white marbles and stucco but there's no pietra dura work that distinguishes Shah Jahan's creation. But it does has four disproportionately large minarets at the end of the large platform. The gardens around are a delight to explore, with the Deccan hills providing a scenic backdrop. To the west of the tomb is a small mosque with finely worked cusped arches and corner minarets. To the north is the Sunheri Mahal, which is easily noticeable for its goldwork.</p>

	<p>Believed to be built between 1651 and 1661 C.E at a mere cost of Rs. 6,68,203-7, Bibi ka Maqbara is one of the finest examples of Mughal architecture. The mausoleum was built by Aurangzeb's son Azam Shah in the memory of his mother, Rabia. Somewhere like the other Mughal Era architecture, this one too has an exquisite architecture, which was built and designed by Ata-ullah, an architect, and Hanspat Rai, an engineer. Tavernier, a French gem merchant, and traveler, quoted it somewhere that to built the mausoleum the marble was brought from a mine near Jaipur. 100's of carts ladened with marble, drawn by at least 12 oxen, were seen by him during his journey from Surat to Golconda. Azam Shah.</p>

	<h1 style="font-size:50px;text-align:center;">Daulatabad Fort</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>A luring tourist attraction of the city of Maharashtra is the Daulatabad Fort which is also known as the Devagiri Fort. It is said that the battles that were fought in this fort were always won. The fort stands on a conical hill and the lower slopes of the hill had been cut for the purpose of more defense. The way to reach the top of the fort is very challenging as one has to pass through a narrow bridge which can hold only two persons at a time. While going towards the summit you will notice huge cannons at almost every interval of the slope. In the middle of the way there is also cave which had been made to puzzle the enemies when they came to attack.</p>
	<p>Another special characteristic of the place is that it is believed that Lord Shiva had stayed on the hills around this region and thus this place had got its name Devagiri which means "Hills of God". So the place also has a mythological connection. The beautiful architecture used in the construction of the fort makes it one of the best places to visit in Daulatabad. The fort has a very complex and intricate structure which makes it even more appealing to the visitors. Tourism to the Devagiri fort also includes exploring the surrounding areas among which the very well known one is the Kagzi Pura which is a very old paper making mill. Then a little distance away you have the Khuldabad which is mainly a place for the sufi saints.</p>

Since then it has adorned the heritage of our country.</p>
