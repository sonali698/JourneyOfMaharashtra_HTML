	<hr>
	<p>Maharashtra has a perfect juxtaposed image; it brings to mind a picture of a diverse state where people of different religions are staying in unison. And what makes these people closer are the festival celebrations, which happens almost every month in the city. People of Maharashtra takes their festival celebration way to seriously, and they completely lose themselves in the gaiety of the festivities, especially during Ganesh Chaturthi. Pilgrims from all walks of life visit the magnificent pandals, lighted up in the different corners of the state and commemorates the homecoming of their favorite deity, Lord Ganesh.</p>
	<p>Each and every festival of Maharashtra has its traditions; they signal the passing of the old and beginning of the new, and victory of good over the bad. Gudi Padwa, yet another famous festival of Maharashtra, marks the beginning of the new year. The festival of Jamashtmi brings out the hidden talent hidden in streets as this is when the high-energy, high-decibel Dahi Handi festival is organized; during which the people follow the footsteps of Krishna by forming a human pyramid to break the Dahi Handi. First of May also plays a special significance for the people of as this when Maharashtra attained its statehood way back in 1960, hence the celebration. On the Maharashtra Day, a procession wafts through the lanes of Mumbai as people revel in the street festival celebrations.</p>
	<p>Since its a Hindu dominated state, it hardly doesn't mean that the festivals of other religions are observed with less cheer and enthusiasm. Festivals like Ugadi, Eid al-Fitr, Jamshed Navroz (Parsi New Year), and Christmas are celebrated with great fervor. And equal importance is given to events that celebrate their creative traditions like Ellora Festival, Kalidas Festival, Pune festivals, Jamshed Navroz, and Sawai Gandharva Sangeet Mahotsav. A diversity of talent from the different corners of the world come together to be a part of the art and cultural events of Maharashtra.</p>
	<p>Plan a visit to Maharashtra during the festival celebration as this when one can see the state in all its glory with streets lit up by ruffles bringing together people from different background.</p>
