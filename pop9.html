Himru shawls of Aurangabad is a less expensive type of brocade in which both silk and cotton threads are used to produce the multi-colored designs. The actual ornamental design is formed on the principle of extra weft figuring. Because of this extra layer of loose silk weft, the Himru shawls are soft, and almost feel like silk. It is believed that Mohamed-bin-Tughlak brought weavers to Aurangabad from Ahmedabad, Banaras and Gujarat, which led to the start of the Himru industry.</p>
	<h4>Paithani Saris</h4>
	<p>The art of weaving Paithani saris is 2000 years old. The yarn used is pure silk and the zari or gold threads are drawn from pure gold. A heavily brocaded Paithani sari takes anywhere from six months to one and a half years to weave.</p>
